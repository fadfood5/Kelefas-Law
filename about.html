            Ashley Kelefas grew up in Palm Beach County, Florida. After
            obtaining her Bachelor's degree in Social Work, she worked for a
            nonprofit organization, where she advocated for South Florida's
            homeless population. While studying law, she interned for a death
            penalty-certified attorney. There, she worked on various civil
            rights, capital, federal, and other criminal cases. The experience
            Ashley gained from her internship and career as a social worker
            fueled her desire for advocacy and the practice of criminal law.
            After graduating from law school, Ashley accepted a position with
            the Ninth Circuit Public Defenderâ€™s Office in Orange County,
            Florida. There, she represented countless clients in both
            misdemeanor and felony cases, including DUI, petty and grand theft,
            domestic violence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,
            possession of a controlled substance, and battery on a law
            enforcement officer, among others. She passionately fought for the
            most underprivileged individuals in the community, achieving nearly
            a dozen acquittals at trial in her first year and securing various
            dismissals. Ashley understands the immense stress her clients
            undergo when facing criminal charges and zealously fights for every
            individual she has the privilege of representing.
